### Learning Objective:
Non-deterministic Search | Simulated Annealing
For problems with large search spaces, randomized search becomes a meaningful option given
partial/ full-information about the domain.<br>

Problem: <br>
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a hard problem, and is simple to state. Given a graph in which the nodes are locations of cities, and edges are labelled with the cost of travelling between cities, find a cycle containing each city exactly once, such that the total cost of the tour is as low as possible.Refer [tsp_lab3_.ipynb](https://github.com/slytechiefrommagentashore/cs302_AritificialIntelligence/blob/main/Lab%203%20Assignment/Lab%203%20Assignment%20_TSP%20problem/tsp_Lab3_.ipynb)<br>
For the state of Rajasthan, find out at least twenty important tourist locations. Suppose your relatives are about to visit you next week. Use Simulated Annealing to plan a cost effective tour of Rajasthan. It is reasonable to assume that the cost of travelling between two locations is proportional to the distance between them.<br>
